# 🚀 GFN-LINUX

This code here is faster and more stable than the original one.

## 🛠️ Things Changed:

- Removed the Discord RPC (Not needed)
- Uses Video Decoding to provide a smoother experience
- Uses a Windows User Agent to prevent the "Unsupported OS" error and throttling
- Migrated everything to TypeScript
- Uses the V8 Engine instead of the NodeJS Engine
- Removed unused Shortcuts (Will be added back in the future)
